Hi! My name is Ainsley Yoshizumi, I am a recent college graduate. I received my bachelors of science in information technology with a cognate in Spanish. I am interested in software development, but anything that has to do with tech or computers will always have my interest! I made this blog to document my career and personal growth as I learn about the newest innovations in tech and whatever else I find interesting!
